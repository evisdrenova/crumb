# Welcome to Crumb

Crumb is an interacive, node-based diagram creator that enables anyone to create beautiful, animated flow diagrams in minutes.

# Roadmap

- lock width and height when shift key is pressed to maintain aspect ratio
- Ability to set connection end types
- Ability to set animated connection color speed
- look at the # const selectedElements = useStore((store) => store.updateNodeDimensions()); to update the node sizing
- ability to change multiple nodes styles by selecting them
- fix the connecting process because right now the handlers don't show bescause they're turned off when it isn't selected - but they should show if at least one node is selected
- ability to delete a node
- move shapes from side nav to the panel
  -ablity to set border radius individually
  - for the background icon type - make it so the selected value it shows in the panel is the icon + the name
  - fix the popovers so that they don't always show - just when you hover over it, right now it's annoying
